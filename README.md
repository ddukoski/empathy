Empathy is a small computer vision and deep learning project for the Digital Image Processing course at FCSE. Empathy detects faces (with Haar Cascades) in video and images and describes their emotion using a trained/to-be-trained CNN.

Please note that the app comes with a preloaded and trained model.

Required packages:

NumPy (numpy), 

PyTorch (torch), 

Keras preprocessing library (keras-preprocessing), 

OpenCV (opencv-python) for Python, 

tkinter, 

Pillow (pillow) and 

Augmentor


If you would like to train the model from scratch, please download the FER2013 dataset from `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013` and put it in the `datasets` (create it if it doesn't exist) directory, then do the following:
  1. Run the `preprocessing/dataset_formatting.py` script (if you are using a different dataset than FER2013, make sure it matches FER2013's column and emotion number format)
  2. Run the `preprocessing/augumentation.py` stript
  3. Run the `preprocessing/training.py` script
